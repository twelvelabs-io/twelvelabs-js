     *   - `chapter`: A chronological list of all the chapters in a video, providing a granular breakdown of its content. For each chapter, the platform returns its starting and end times, measured in seconds from the beginning of the video clip, a descriptive headline that offers a brief of the events or activities within that part of the video, and an accompanying summary that elaborates on the headline.
     *   - `highlight`: A chronologically ordered list of the most important events within a video. Unlike chapters, highlights only capture the key moments, providing a snapshot of the video's main topics. For each highlight, the platform returns its starting and end times, measured in seconds from the beginning of the video, a title, and a brief description that captures the essence of this part of the video.
